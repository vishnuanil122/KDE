# KDE (Kernal density estimation)
Kernal density estimation distribution plots using python

The Kernel Density tool calculates the density of features in a neighborhood around those features. It can be calculated for both point and line features.

Possible uses include finding density of houses, crime reports, or roads or utility lines influencing a town or wildlife habitat. The population field could be used to weight some features more heavily than others, depending on their meaning, or to allow one point to represent several observations.
